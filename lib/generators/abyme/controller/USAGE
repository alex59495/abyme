Description:
    Injects the call to the `abyme_attributes` in the strong params definition of the targeted controller.
    Also works with namespaced controllers.

Example:
    Before :
    def project_params
        params.require(:project).permit(:title, :description)
    end

    rails generate abyme:controller Projects

    After:
    def project_params
        params.require(:project).permit(abyme_attributes, :title, :description)
    end
