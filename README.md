# Abyme üï≥

abyme is a modern take on handling dynamic nested forms in Rails 6+ using StimulusJS.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'abyme'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle
    $ yarn add 'abyme'


Assuming you [already installed Stimulus](https://stimulusjs.org/handbook/introduction), add this in `app/javascript/controllers/index.js` :
```javascript
// app/javascript/controllers/index.js
import { Application } from "stimulus"
import { definitionsFromContext } from "stimulus/webpack-helpers"
// Add this line below
import { AbymeController } from 'abyme'

const application = Application.start()
const context = require.context("controllers", true, /_controller\.js$/)
application.load(definitionsFromContext(context))
// And this one
application.register('abyme', AbymeController)
```

## What are nested forms and why a new gem ?

Nested forms (or more accurately *nested fields* or *nested attributes*) are forms that deal with associated models. Let's picture a `Project` model that `has_many :tasks`. A nested form will allow you to create a project along with one or several tasks **within a single form**. If `Tasks` were to have associations on their own, like `:comments`, you could also, still in the same form, instantiate comments along with their parent models.

Rails provides [its own helper](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v6.0.1/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper.html#method-i-fields_for) to handle nested attributes. **abyme** is basically a smart wrapper around it, offering easier syntax along with some fancy additions. To work properly, some configuration will be required in both models and controllers (see below).

What Rails doesn't provide natively is the possibility to **dynamically add new associations on the fly**, which requires Javascript implementation. What this means it that you would normally have to know in advance how many fields you'd like to display (1, 2 or any number of `:tasks`), which isn't very usable in this day and age. This is what the [cocoon gem](https://github.com/nathanvda/cocoon) has been helping with for the past 7 years. This gem still being implemented in JQuery (which [Rails dropped as a dependency](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/25208)), we wanted to propose a more plug'n'play approach, using Basecamp's [Stimulus](https://stimulusjs.org/) instead.

## Basic Configuration

### Models
Let's consider a to-do application with Projects having many Taks, themselves having many Comments.
```ruby
# models/project.rb
class Project < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :tasks, inverse_of: :project, dependent: :destroy
  validates :title, :description, presence: true
end

# models/task.rb
class Task < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :project
  has_many :comments, inverse_of: :task, dependent: :destroy
  validates :title, :description, presence: true
end

# models/comment.rb
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :task
  validates :content, presence: true
end
```
The end-goal here is to be able to create a project along with different tasks, and immediately add comments to some of these tasks ; all within a single form.
What we'll have is a 2-level nested form. Thus, we'll need to add these lines to both `Project` and `Task` :
```ruby
# models/project.rb
class Project < ApplicationRecord
  include Abyme::Model
  #...
  abyme_for :tasks
end

# models/task.rb
class Task < ApplicationRecord
  include Abyme::Model
  #...
  abyme_for :comments
end
```

### Controller
Since we're dealing with one form, we're only concerned with one controller : the one the form routes to. In our example, this would be the `ProjectsController`.
The only configuration needed here will concern our strong params. Nested attributes require a very specific syntax to white-list the permitted attributes. It looks like this :

```ruby
def project_params
  params.require(:project).permit(
    :title, :description, tasks_attributes: [
      :id, :title, :description, :_destroy, comments_attributes: [
        :id, :content, :_destroy
      ]
    ]
  )
end
```
A few explanations here. 

* To permit a nested model attributes in your params, you'll need to pass the `association_attributes: [...]` hash at the end of your resource attributes. Key will always be `association_name` followed by `_attributes`, while the value will be an array of symbolized attributes, just like usual.

  **Note**: if your association is a singular one (`has_one` or `belongs_to`, the association will be singular ; if a Project `has_one :owner`, you would then need to pass `owner_attributes: [...]`)

* You may have remarked the presence of `id` and `_destroy` among those params. These are necessary for edit actions : if you want to allow your users to destroy or update existing records, these are **mandatory**.  Otherwise, Rails won't be able to recognize these records as existing ones, and will just create new ones. More info [here](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/NestedAttributes/ClassMethods.html).

## Basic Usage

Dealing with nested attributes means you'll generally have to handle a few things inside your form:
* Display fields for the persisted records (here, already existing `:tasks`)
* Display fields for the new records (future `:tasks` not yet persisted)
* A button to trigger the addition of fields for a new resource (an `Add a new task` button)
* A button to remove fields for a given resource (`Remove task`)

abyme provides helper methods for all these. Here's how our form for `Project` looks like when using default values:

```ruby
# views/projects/_form.html.erb
<%= simple_form_for @project do |f| %>
  <%= f.input :title %>
  <%= f.input :description %>
  <%= f.submit 'Save' %>

  <%= abymize(:tasks, f) do |abyme| %>
    <%= abyme.records %>
    <%= abyme.new_records %>
    <%= add_association %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
```

`abyme.records` will contain the persisted associations fields, while `abyme.new_records` will contain fields for the new associations. `add_association` will by default generate a button with a text of type "Add `resource_name`". To work properly, this method **has** to be called inside the block passed to the `abymize` method.

Now where's the code for these fields ? abyme will assume a partial to be present in the directory `/views/abyme` with a name respecting this naming convention (just like with [cocoon](https://github.com/nathanvda/cocoon#basic-usage)): `_singular_association_name_fields.html.erb`. 

Here's what this partial looks like:
```ruby
# views/abyme/_task_fields.html.erb
<%= f.input :title %>
<%= f.input :description %>
<%= f.hidden_field :_destroy %>

<%= remove_association(tag: :div) do %>
  <i class="fas fa-trash"></i>
<% end %>
```

Here is where you'll find the `remove_association` button. Here, we pass it an option to make it a `<div>`, as well as a block to customize its content. Don't forget the `_destroy` attribute, needed to mark items for destruction.

### What about the controller ?

What about it ? Well, not much. That's the actual magical thing about `nested_attributes` : once your model is aware of its acceptance of those for a given association and your strong params are correctly configured, there's nothing else to do.

`@project.create(project_params)` is all you'll need to save a project along with its descendants üë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëß

### Auto mode

Let's now take care of our comments fields. We'll add these using our neat *automatic mode*: just stick this line at the end of the partial:
```ruby
# views/abyme/_task_fields.html.erb
# ... rest of the partial above
<%= abymize(:comments, f) %>
```
Where's the rest of the code ? Well, if the default configuration you saw above in the `_form.html.erb` suits you, and the order in which the different resources appear feels right (persisted first, new fields second, and the 'Add' button last), then you can just spare the block, and it will be taken care of for you. We'll just write our `_comment_fields.html.erb` partial in the `views/abyme` directory and we'll be all set.

## Advanced usage
### Models
In models, the `abyme_for :association` acts as an alias for this command :

```ruby
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :association, reject_if: :all_blank, :allow_destroy: true
```

Which is the way you would configure `nested_attributes` 90% of the time. Should you want to pass [any available options](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/NestedAttributes/ClassMethods.html#method-i-accepts_nested_attributes_for) to this method or change those, you may just pass them as with the original method :
```ruby
  abyme_for :association, limit: 3, allow_destroy: false
```

### Views

#### #records
A few options can be passed to `abyme.records`:
* `collection:` : allows you to pass a collection of your choice to only display specific objects.
```ruby
  <%= abymize(:tasks, f) do |abyme| %>
    <%= abyme.records(collection: @project.tasks.where(done: false)) %>
    <%= abyme.new_records %>
    <%= add_association %>
  <% end %>
```
* `order:` : allows you to pass an ActiveRecord `order` method to sort your instances the way you want.
```ruby
  <%= abymize(:tasks, f) do |abyme| %>
    <%= abyme.records(order: { created_at: :asc }) %>
    <%= abyme.new_records %>
    <%= add_association %>
  <% end %>
```
* `html:` : gives you the possibility to add any HTML attribute you may want to the container. By default, an `abyme--fields` class is already present.
```ruby
  <%= abymize(:tasks, f) do |abyme| %>
    <%= abyme.records(html: { id: "persisted-records" }) %>
    <%= abyme.new_records %>
    <%= add_association %>
  <% end %>
```

#### #new_records
Here a the options that can be passed to `abyme.new_records`:
* `position:` : allows you to specify whether new fields added dynamically should go at the top or at the bottom. `:end` is the default value.
```ruby
  <%= abymize(:tasks, f) do |abyme| %>
    <%= abyme.records(position: :start) %>
    <%= abyme.new_records %>
    <%= add_association %>
  <% end %>
```
* `partial:` : allows you to indicate a custom partial.
```ruby
  <%= abymize(:tasks, f) do |abyme| %>
    <%= abyme.records %>
    <%= abyme.new_records(position: :end, partial: 'projects/task_fields') %>
    <%= add_association %>
  <% end %>
```
* `html:` : gives you the possibility to add any HTML attribute you may want to the container. By default, an `abyme--fields` class is already present.
```ruby
  <%= abymize(:tasks, f) do |abyme| %>
    <%= abyme.records %>
    <%= abyme.new_records(html: { id: "new-records" }) %>
    <%= add_association %>
  <% end %>
```

#### #abymize
*When in auto mode*, the abymize method can take a few options:
* `add-button-text:` : this will set the `add_association` button text to the string of your choice.
* All options that should be passed to either `records` or `new_records` can be passed here and will be passed down.
